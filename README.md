# JS Recursion

I created this repository to provide beginners and intermediates in JavaScript with examples where recursion is used to solve practical problems. The files in it contain different recursive functions, most of which do just the same thing.

The repo was initially created to store all of the code used in this [article][JS Recursion Article]. But after some thought, I decided to structure it more so it could serve other purposes other than just storing my poorly-structured article source code.

The files which contain the recursive functions are those in the **js** folder at the root of the project. Each file contains a description of its content at the top, and each function/block of code has a comment (short or long) explaining what it does.


## Folder structure

As I said earlier, the project folders containing the recursive functions are located in the **js** folder at the root of the project. These files contain different implementations of the same solution to practical problems.

The **script.js** file at the root of the project is meant to be a playground to run random code. It also has access to all functions and variables defined in all other JavaScript files in the project. So, you can use it for testing out code if you don't want to make direct edits to the files in the **js** folder.

The **index.html** file contains nothing other than links to the JavaScript files in the project. So, to test out all codes, just open this HTML file in your browser.
